        <h2>NEWS</h2>
        <p>
     
Dragon Breeds: BREAKPOINT will be the first major evolution of the game since its original release in 2022. Games will now be faster, ramp more intensely, and support larger player counts. The “Breakpoint” mechanic, coming in the 2024 Underworld Expansion (as well as the 8-faction game reboot, Dragon Breeds: BREAKPOINT), is the key to this shift in gameplay quality.
<br><br></p>
<h3>RETURN TO LIFE ENRAGED</h3><p>
Players no longer begin with a set number of health and lose it over the course of the game. Instead, each player has a two-sided identity card, with a stage-1 side and an enrage side.

<h3>STAGE 1</h3><p>
While a player is stage 1, they have a BREAKPOINT of 4 that resets every turn, so three damage taken in one turn is treated as null once the turn is over. However, stage 1 players have an ability that triggers whenever they deal damage to enemy players that typically help them power-scale faster by giving them resources and/or slow the damaged player down by taking away resources from them.
<br><br>
When a stage 1 player takes 4 or more damage in the same turn, their BREAKPOINT is broken and they are K.O.’d. They are removed from the game for a round, giving them immunity from other player’s attacks, until their next turn, at the start of which they return to the game with their ID card flipped over to its enrage side.

<h3>ENRAGE</h3><p>
Enraged players have a BREAKPOINT of 2, and no longer have their stage 1 ability. In its place, they have a far more aggressive enrage ability.
<br><br>However, though enraged players have an attack power increase, their new BREAKPOINT of 2 makes them more vulnerable to being K.O.’d a second time and removed from the game permanently.
<br><br></p>
<h3>PLAYER COUNT SCALING</h3><p>
Because the set bars players need to hit to get a K.O. each game are 4 and 2, regardless of the player count, and because the BREAKPOINT of each player resets to its full value each turn, Dragon Breeds is much more of an arms race in which all players are scaling the power of their deck as quickly as possible, until they begin to pop-off every so often and start knocking out enemies. Though politics are still important, their impact on the game is reduced, allowing Dragon Breeds to be played with far more various player counts without screwing up the balancing too far.
<br><br></p>
While a player count of four remains optimal, decks that struggled or were overpowered at two-player are now much more even, and five to eight player games are definitely reserved for players who are experienced at the game and can ramp their deck fast enough so that the whole party isn’t playing for three hours. Just remember this phrase when choosing your player count: “Two is a flick, eight is an evening, but four is optimal.”
<br><br></p>
<h3>BALANCE CHANGES</h3><p>
With the new revamps of Dragon Breeds, we've changed some cards in the release of the game to level the playing field further and allow for alternate strategies. However, you don’t need the new balancing to play with the new character system with your original copy of Dragon Breeds: OVERWORLD for the early buyers out there. Just check out the new ID cards on our website once they’re up and play with the new abilities.
