        <h2>RED</h2>
        <p>Bulldoze through defenders and reduce your opponents to ash.
            <br><br>
            Difficulty: SIMPLE <br>
            Archetype: BEAT-DOWN
        </p><h3><br>STRATEGY GUIDE</h3>
        <p>
            Red is as classic as Dragon Breeds can get. You have one job: 
            fireball your way through enemy defenses. To complete your quests
            and deal damage, you need dragons that give you fireballs and increase 
            their damage. To take someone out, you all you need some beef to send through.
            <br><br>
            While Red's attacks can be inconsistent, its defensive game is one of the best 
            of all the factions. Every one of its common dragons either provides extra 
            defensive value against various factions or allows for a strong "punish", 
            allowing Red to gather resources or work your way toward your Legendary Dragon 
            in response to an opponent attacking Red on a turn they shouldn't have.
