        <h2>GREEN</h2>
        <p>Most Green dragons are gentle in the wild, at least, until their hives are disturbed.
            <br><br>
            Difficulty: INTERMEDIATE <br>
            Archetype: HYPER-CARRY
            </p><h3><br>STRATEGY GUIDE</h3>
            <p>
            Green has the most unique ability synergy in the game of Dragon Breeds. While 
            it does have the capabilities of swarming around enemy defenses, it's not a pure 
            swarm deck. In fact, there is only one dragon that can allow it to pop off into 
            a near-garunteed to be lethal attack: its Epic dragon, Stampede, which also happens 
            to be the most expensive card to purchase in the game.<br><br>
            The archetype "HYPER-CARRY" comes from Green's reliance on Stampede in order to 
            take other players out. Until Green buys Stampede, it is easily the most passive 
            faction in the game. Most of its dragons don't cause anything to happen directly 
            in the battlefield, but have abilities that affect player's purchasing abilities 
            by making things easier for Green and harder for opponents.<br><br>
            However, once Green gets is Stampede, it usually doesn't need to buy any more dragons. 
            The more efficient the deck can become, and the more often the Green player is able 
            to draw their win condition, the better chance they have at hitting their opponents 
            hard and taking home the crown.
