            <h2>SWARM DRAGON</h2>
            <p>Token Dragons that survive defense remain in front of their owner.
                Token Dragons that die, or are still posessed at the 
                end of a player's own draw phase, return to their source. <br> <br>
                While a dragon is taken from a Supply as a token card, its spot
                in the Supply is not restocked. When that dragon is lost/dies, it
                returns to that spot in the Supply.
                <br><br>
                NOTE: Token cards cannot be trashed or discarded by player actions
                or dragon abilities.
