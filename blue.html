        <h2>BLUE</h2>
        <p>It's always a nice day when you're holding your entire deck in your hand.
            <br><br>
            Difficulty: INTERMEDIATE <br>
            Archetype: SWARM
        </p>
        <h3><br>STRATEGY GUIDE</h3>
        <p>
            If you like drawing cards without the certainty that the next card will 
            be the thing that wins you the game or keeps you alive, then Blue is the deck 
            for you. Blue thrives as the game last longer, and is the only faction 
            capable of dealing well over twenty damage in a single turn in the latter 
            rounds.<br><br>
            It should be noted that the dragons in Blue that provide the least defensive value also are its
            most dangerous, so players often have to play their politics well in the 
            early game or refrain from buying only their main synergy dragons at the start. 
            It can take a few turns to learn Blue's synergies and for players to develope 
            their personal playstyle, so be patient when starting out with this faction. 
            Based on the circle a player is in, Blue can range from difficult to pull off 
            to terrifyingly broken. It's this inconsistency that keeps a lot of players 
            coming back to Blue game after game.<br><br>
            Blue is less reliant on its Legendary and Epic dragons than some
            other factions, though both can pack a punch. What Blue is concerned
            with is the number of dragons in its deck. In fact, Blue is the only
            faction that becomes more powerful as the number of dragons not in its
            hand inscreases. <br><br>
            With most factions, you're goal is to get your best dragons in your hand. 
            With Blue, your job is to have initiator dragons that draw into combos that 
            allow you to draw even more cards, until you're able to swarm across the entire 
            battlefield for attack or defense. <br><br>
            Just make sure you read the abilities carefully and understand the combat phase. 
            For example, Hurricane is a 1-Strength-Value Rare dragon that doubles its owner's 
            card draw from dragons' abilities, but this would be absolutely busted when defending, 
            so its ability has the condition "While you are attacking...". Also, while you are 
            attacking, because you play dragons one at a time, as long as you haven't established that 
            you are done playing dragons, you are free to keep playing them as long as you are drawing into 
            more and more dragons. <br><br>
            That's all we have for you here. If you're a Blue main, best of luck to you. 
            You're going to need it.
