    <h1>Welcome to the Dragon Breeds Universe</h1>
    <p1>Hi. My name is Seth Blake. I am a student at the University of Michigan studying computer science'</p1>
    <p1>and Dragon Breeds has been my main side project since I was looking for ways to keep myself busy</p1>
    <p1>and entertain my younger siblings during the spring and summer of 2020.</p1>
    <p1>Since then, a handful of friends, family, and I have iterated the game design and spent an uncountable</p1>
    <p1>number of hours bringing the game to life with our artwork and graphic design. So far, we've</p1>
    <p1>released our first set of the many we've designed, Dragon Breeds: OVERWORLD, and the game has</p1>
    <p1>brought in over $1000 in gross revenue and has been purchased by early playtesters in multiple</p1>
    <p1>states accross the US.</p1>
