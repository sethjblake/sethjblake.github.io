        <p>Big dragon hit hard.
            <br><br>
            Difficulty: SIMPLE <br>
            Archetype: BEAT-DOWN

    </p><h3><br>STRATEGY GUIDE</h3>
    <p>
        Orange is easily the most beginner-friendly faction, while its straightforward 
        mechanics allow for some more difficult combos for more advanced players picking 
        up the old 'dumb and ugly' faction. While there are some Orange dragons that don't 
        combo, any player is safe buying a mix of dragons. Also, though Orange can be reliant 
        on its direct-damage dealing Rockslide dragon to take out enemies in later rounds 
        of the game, players have the choice of putting all their eggs in their Legendary 
        dragon's basket by choosing Obsidian, which is a great early-game unlock and 
        finisher. <br><br>Note that, though Orange dragons pack a big punch, Orange can have 
        some trouble ramping its dragon count as quickly as other factions, so as 
        players learn to balance their coin aquisition and trashing actions they can 
        become more and more of a single-minded killing machine.
